CS 3750 Project - Police Communication Portal

Created in Fall 2013 using java as part of a group collaboration to provide the Georgia Tech Police with a means of organizing their own incident reports and communicating more directly with the Atlanta Police Department. The project provided is mainly a high fidelity prototype.

All main screens were written by Catherine Chapman, denoted with our team name 'The Feds,' and the chat window functionality was provided by another team member.
